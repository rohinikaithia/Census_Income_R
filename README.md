# Census_Income_R
I successfully executed a comprehensive Data Science project focused on the "Census Income" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This project involved extensive data preprocessing, manipulation, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling using various machine learning algorithms.

Data Preprocessing:
1) Handled missing values by replacing them with NA and removed corresponding rows.
2) Eliminated whitespaces from columns for enhanced data cleanliness.

Data Manipulation:
1) Utilized the dplyr package to manipulate and analyze the dataset.
2) Extracted specific columns and subsets based on defined criteria.
3) Conducted various data extraction and manipulation tasks to derive meaningful insights.

Data Visualization:
1) Created informative visualizations using ggplot2 to depict relationships within the dataset.
2) Developed a bar plot, histogram, scatter plot, and box plot to visually represent data characteristics.

Linear Regression:
1) Implemented a linear regression model to predict "hours.per.week" based on the "education.num" variable.
2) Evaluated model performance using root-mean-square error (RMSE).

Logistic Regression:
1) Executed both simple and multiple logistic regression models to predict yearly income ("X") based on relevant variables.
2) Explored accuracy vs. cut-off, confusion matrix, and ROC curve for model evaluation.

Decision Tree and Random Forest:
1) Developed decision tree and random forest models to predict yearly income, showcasing proficiency in ensemble learning.

This project not only enhanced my skills in data preprocessing, manipulation, and visualization but also demonstrated my proficiency in implementing various machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling. The successful execution of these tasks showcases my ability to derive meaningful insights and make informed decisions using data science methodologies.
